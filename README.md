First thing first need to set variables (qtr change, %change, total volumes, ticker, market open, market close and need a counter for volume as i go through each ticker)

add column fields (table 1) to summarize the stocks
 -need to add each day in the qtr for stock to get total volume
 - get market open and market close for 1st and last day
 - format new columns to display as percentage "0.00%"
 - calculate % change


add column fields (table 2) for greatest increase, greatest decrease, and overall highest volume
  - format fields for percentage "0.00%
  - find biggest increase, biggest decrease, and biggest over all volume

conditional format for anything over 0 change in green and anything less than 0 in red

run the script through each worksheet (ws)
